## About 

Imagine you are a security or defense analyst. Analyze the data and draw conclusions on the distribution and nature of terrorist incidents recorded around the world. In your analysis, include maps that visualize the location of different incidents. The analysis will also answer the following questions:

1. How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there certain regions where this trend is different from the global average?

2. Is the number of incidents and the number of casualties correlated? Can you spot any irregularities or outliers?

3. What are the most common methods of attacks? Does it differ in various regions or in time?

4. Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread.

## Data Description

The provided compressed file globalterrorismdb_0718dist.tar.bz2 is an extract from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) - an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 - 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

## Conclusion
- The Middle East and North Africa stand out as hot zones for terrorism, warranting focused attention in these regions.
Countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan have borne the brunt of terrorist attacks, necessitating heightened awareness and security measures by their governments.
- Terrorists frequently target private citizens, army personnel, and police forces, underscoring the need for enhanced security measures in these areas.
- Bombing and explosive attacks emerge as the most commonly used methods by terrorists, urging governments to strengthen border controls and enforce stringent arms laws.
- A significant number of attacks are attributed to unknown or unaffiliated groups, highlighting the challenge of identifying and countering lone actors or isolated incidents.
- The global community should consider efforts to combat terrorism, particularly since there has been a notable surge in terrorist activities post-2005.
